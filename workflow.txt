now:
test token label stuff on pos data
why is specialChar ending up in the labeldomain?
is there a version of logsoftmax on the innermost dimension? 

before release:
#change names of example scripts

#ApplyModel 
.lua file and shell script (write out the predictions somewhere. also map them back out to strings)

#token labels
	still need to pad annotation for length rounding and minlength
	make sure that the final output shape is b x T x L

#optimization
	better default values for SGD.

#regularization
	add option for regularization

#loading word embeddings
	add pretrainedEmbeddings option to ModelTraining
	(see examplePretrainedEmbeddings.sh)

***affecting DMF stuff:
is tagging evaluation wrong?
