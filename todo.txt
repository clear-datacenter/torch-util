now:

preprocess is being called on test data. it's just done up front
why is specialChar ending up in the labeldomain?
is there a version of logsoftmax on the innermost dimension? 

before release:

#switch data preprocessing so that it's done up front once. 

#document the whole preprocess thing 

# why is the domain size 47 rather than 46?
#change names of example scripts

#ApplyModel 
.lua file and shell script (write out the predictions somewhere. also map them back out to strings)

#optimization
	better default values for SGD.

#regularization
	add option for regularization

#loading word embeddings
	add pretrainedEmbeddings option to ModelTraining
	(see examplePretrainedEmbeddings.sh)

# make sure num_actual_data is working
