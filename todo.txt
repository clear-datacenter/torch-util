I don't like the sequencercriterion stuff. go back to reshaping. need to figure out how to add a jointable to rnn output. 

#ApplyModel 
.lua file and shell script (write out the predictions somewhere. also map them back out to strings)

#switch train data preprocessing so that it's done up front once. 


#optimization
	better default values for SGD.
